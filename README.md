# JavaScript30 - Day 12: Key Sequence Detection

Welcome to Day 12 of JavaScript30! ðŸš€ In this challenge, we'll be working on creating a key sequence detection using JavaScript.


## The Project

Today's project involves building a key sequence detector. When a specific sequence of keys is typed, a secret action is triggered. It's a fun and interactive way to demonstrate the power of event listeners and handling user input in JavaScript.

## Key Concepts

- Event listeners
- Keyboard events (`keyup`)
- Key sequences
- Array manipulation
