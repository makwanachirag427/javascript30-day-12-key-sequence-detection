# JavaScript30 - Day 12: Key Sequence Detection

Welcome to Day 12 of JavaScript30! ðŸš€ In this challenge, we'll be working on creating a key sequence detection using JavaScript.

## Live Demo

## The Project

Today's project involves building a key sequence detector. When a specific sequence of keys is typed, a secret action is triggered. It's a fun and interactive way to demonstrate the power of event listeners and handling user input in JavaScript.

## Key Concepts

- Event listeners
- Keyboard events (`keydown`)
- Key sequences
- Array manipulation

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need:
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- A web browser

## Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Type the secret key sequence to trigger the hidden action.
4. Have fun experimenting with different key sequences!

## Example Key Sequence

In the provided starter code, the secret key sequence is set to "webdev". Try typing this sequence to see the action.

```javascript
const secretCode = 'webdev';
```

Feel free to change the secret key sequence to something of your choice in the JavaScript file (`script.js`).
